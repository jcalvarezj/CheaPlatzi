# CheaPlatzi
Web application that helps the user compare prices of items among different e-commerce sites, and thus find the cheapest offer

## Requirements

**Python 3.x**, any version of **pip**, and **virtualenv**


## Installation

- Clone into a new directory and navigate inside it

- Create a new virtual environment using **virtualenv**

    For example, `virtualenv venv`

- Activate venv

    For Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate` or `.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat` 

    For Unix/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate` or `./venv/bin/activate.sh`

    (Run the `deactivate` command when done with this software's execution)

- Install dependencies

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Testing

To run unit tests on the scraper module, simply run `pytest` at the project's root.


## Execution

At present only the "scraper" module has been implemented (an initial draft/approach). It consumes [MercadoLibre](https://www.mercadolibre.com/)'s API to access Colombia's list of products from the consoles and video games category and shows an example of filtered products (those that match with "Playstation" in their titles); and it uses **scrapy** to formally scrap products of the same category from [OLX Colombia](https://www.olx.com.co/) and [Éxito](https://www.exito.com/).

To run, use 

On Windows: `python .\scraper\scraper.py --site=<index> [--verbose=<0|1>]`

On Linux/Unix: `python3 ./scraper/scraper.py --site=<index> [--verbose=<0|1>]`

The indexes for the sites are:

0: MercadoLibre

1: OLX

2: Éxito

...

The optional `verbose` argument enables to see detailed information about the response bodies from the performed requests to the APIs
